<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>omething</span> unusual was about
to happen&mdash;any one could see
that; the tall pine trees swayed and
nodded to each other as if whispering
together, the leaves blew up
against a corner of the fence as
though they meant to sweep the
old-fashioned brick path clean, and
the gate swung to and fro on
its hinges as in anticipation of a
visitor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In a far-away corner of the
United States stood an old farm-house
which had put on its company
manners and quite left off
being an every-day house, though
it really never could be called an
&#8220;every-day&#8221; house&mdash;it was too old
for that.</p>

<p>Ever so many children had
been born there, and had grown
up under its sheltering roof, loved,
married and had gone out into the
world; it was a <i>very</i> old house,
and could have told wonderful
stories if any one had listened to
them; no, it could not be called
an every-day house at all, but to-day
it had a look of expectancy
quite different from its usual
sleepy air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus007.jpg"><img src="images/illus007_th.jpg"
alt="Aunt Laura" title="Aunt Laura" /></a></p>

<p>The ancient box-hedge by the
rose-garden stood like an old
soldier at attention, so! The fresh
muslin curtains at the window were
stiff with starch, they would not
stir an inch to the breeze blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in. The old farm-house was trying
to look young again, that was
it! To look young again: how
many of us can do that, eh! for
it was expecting a visitor, a very
young visitor indeed, a little boy
was coming.</p>

<p>He was not an ordinary little
boy, or at least the people at the
farm-house (Aunt Laura and Uncle
Sam) did not think so&mdash;because
his mother when she was a little
girl had gone there for a visit
years and years ago, just as he
was coming to-day, and she had
loved every nook and cranny of
the old house as they hoped he
would love it, and to those two
people, it seemed almost as if she
were coming back again, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
really couldn&#8217;t happen, for that was
ever so long ago.</p>

<p>But she had sent her little boy
instead, hoping that the change of
air would do him good after the
winter months spent leaning over
school books. So in the quaint
low-ceiled bedroom upstairs, sheets
that smelled of lavender, with
beautiful hand-embroidered initials,
made by some bride for her
trousseau long ago, were spread
on the tall four-poster bed with its
curious starched valence and silk
patch-work quilt; the pitcher on
the wash-stand had been filled to
the brim with cool clear spring
water, queer knit towels in basket
weave design hung ready for use,
and a delicious odor of home-made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
bread floated up from the regions
below.</p>

<p>It was the little boy&#8217;s first
journey, everything was new to
him&mdash;when he got off at the station
Uncle Sam met him and lifted him
up to the front seat of the carriage
with his hand bag tucked in behind,
as he had lifted the little
boy&#8217;s mother up and seated her
beside him, years ago. And so
they drove out together along the
broad country roads, past the green
meadows, where quiet cows cropped
the grass, until they came within
sight of the farm and windmill and
turned into the leafy lane under the
spreading chestnut trees and stopped
at the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus011.jpg"><img src="images/illus011_th.jpg"
alt="Aunt Laura was there to welcome him." title="Aunt Laura was there to welcome him." /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><i>Aunt Laura was there to welcome him.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Aunt Laura was there to welcome
him&mdash;the little boy&#8217;s name
was Laurie, he had been given the
name out of compliment to Aunt
Laura; somehow or other it was
almost like &#8220;coming home&#8221; instead
of &#8220;going away&#8221; he thought, it
was so home-like; perhaps it was
because everything was so very,
very old, that their newness and
strangeness had entirely worn off.
Perhaps it was because his mother
had so often told him about it all,
that everything seemed so familiar.</p>

<p>He had to ask ever so many
questions, polite questions you
know, for he was not a rude little
boy at all, but it seemed so wonderful
to him to be here at last that
he could not help exclaiming at
everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>There was the parlor just as
he had imagined it, with the row
of seashells across the mantle and
the door opening into the porch
and garden and beyond the library
with its great deep fireplace, its
old-fashioned andirons and red
brick hearth.</p>

<p>Nothing was new in the old
house, everything had been made
years and years ago when there
was no machinery, and chairs and
furniture had to be turned by hand;
for that reason people who made
them took more pains than they
do now, so that they would last
a long time, and only the colours
in the brocades had faded and the
silk worn away in the cross-stitch
work of the antimacassars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Laurie went from room to room
with Aunt Laura, looking at everything.
&#8220;Will you show me the cow-pitcher,
Aunt Laura?&#8221; he asked,
and Aunt Laura laughed and opened
a deep cupboard, where the best
china was kept, and took the pitcher
down from a high shelf. Such a
curious pitcher, it was, a brown
and white china cow&mdash;I&#8217;m sure it
must have been very, very old, for I
never see pitchers like it now-a-days.
The tail was curved into a handle,
and the mouth was the spout!</p>

<p>Aunt Laura said that she would
keep it on the table every day, full
of cream for his porridge, just as
she had done for his mother, when
she, as a little girl, had stayed at
the farm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus015.jpg"><img src="images/illus015_th.jpg"
alt="Aunt Laura shows Laurie the cow-pitcher" title="Aunt Laura shows Laurie the cow-pitcher" /></a></p>

<p>When supper came, how good
everything tasted! The home-cured
ham, delicious butter made on the
farm, great slices of fresh bread
and schmeirkase&mdash;I don&#8217;t believe
many of you boys and girls know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
what &#8220;Schmeirkase&#8221; is, do you?
Well, anyway, it is made somehow
from thick sour cream, so thick
that it is put in a bag and hung
up in the dairy until it is time to
be eaten&mdash;when I was a little girl
and visited a farm they used to
have schmeirkase for supper, and
I always hoped they would offer
me a second helping and they always
did! There were strawberries
too, and stewed rhubarb, and chocolate
layer cake. And Aunt Laura
put the cake away after supper in
a round tin box, in a corner of
the cupboard, and gave Laurie a
great slice the next morning to
eat, for fear he would grow hungry
before dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as glad as I can be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; he said, and Uncle
Sam and Aunt Laura smiled at
each other. &#8220;So like his mother,&#8221;
said Aunt Laura and Laurie wondered
how he could be like his mother,
for his mother was ever so much
taller then he, and ever so much
more &#8220;grown up.&#8221;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus017.jpg"><img src="images/illus017_th.jpg"
alt="Flower ornament" title="Flower ornament" /></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter</span> supper, Laurie slipped
his small hand inside Uncle
Sam&#8217;s big one, and they started
out together to see the farm, the
big collie dog &#8220;Shep&#8221; running along
beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen so many animals
in all my life,&#8221; he exclaimed,
as they came up to the great gate
that shut in the barnyard, &#8220;except
perhaps in the Zoo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we stop here for a
moment?&#8221; said Uncle Sam, lifting
Laurie up and seating him on the
gate-post, where he could see all
over the yard at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how fine!&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Laurie, &#8220;I feel just like a little bird
that perches on a tree, and looks
down on the cows underneath, and
isn&#8217;t a bit afraid of their horns!&#8221;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus019.jpg"><img src="images/illus019_th.jpg"
alt="Uncle Sam and Laurie" title="Uncle Sam and Laurie" /></a></p>

<p>Uncle Sam laughed, for he knew
the cows would not hurt him, nevertheless
he kept his arm around
Laurie to be sure, for he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
little city boy, and city boys only
see pictures of cows in books, and
Uncle Sam thought Laurie might
be a weeny bit afraid. Bossie,
Bonnie Bee, Lilian and Daisy, the
cows, were standing around waiting
to be milked, switching their tails
and moo-oo-ing now and then;
some would wander over to the
wide horse trough, over which the
water spilled, and bend their heads
until their mouths touched the
water, when they would drink in
great gulps, then turn away with
dripping chins.</p>

<p>Just then there was the sound
of hoofs, and old &#8220;Sue,&#8221; &#8220;Magic&#8221;
and &#8220;Marvel&#8221; and the colt &#8220;Arbutus&#8221;
raced up from the pasture,
and into the barnyard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Sam drew a handful of
apples out of his capacious pockets,
and the horses came whinneying
and ate them out of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m up here,&#8221; laughed
Laurie, but Uncle Sam latched the
gate, and lifted him down, for
there was ever so much more to
be seen.</p>

<p>Over in the pig-sty the old
mother sow and her family of pigs
were pushing each other out of
the way to see who could get the
most supper, some of them being
impolite enough to stand with their
feet in the trough, but of course
that is considered correct in pig
society.</p>

<p>The little pigs were cunning,
with their bright eyes and curly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tails, and even the old sow was
admirable, for she would grunt as
though to say &#8220;Did you ever see
so fine a family; I have taught
them that the best things in this
world must be hunted for, and to
look out for themselves, yes! they
have been brought up properly, I
have a right to be proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laurie had never seen a real
pump before, so they stopped and
he had a drink of the cool well
water. How refreshing it was!
Next they peeped into the chicken
house, deserted, except for a few
old mother hens, sitting on their
eggs, who, when they saw Laurie,
set up such a fuss that he quickly
came out again.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus022.jpg"><img src="images/illus022_th.jpg"
alt="Chickens" title="Chickens" /></a></p>

<p>As they came near an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
brown hen sitting in the grass,
Laurie laughed with delight when
she got up, and a whole brood
of downy yellow chicks ran from
under her wing.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus023.jpg"><img src="images/illus023_th.jpg"
alt="Laurie with the hen and chicks" title="Laurie with the hen and chicks" /></a></p>

<p>Uncle Sam now took Laurie
back to the barn to see the milking,
and they threaded their way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the dim twilight of the stable, past
the tired horses munching their
oats, to the cow-shed, frightening
an old hen off her nest, where she
had laid her eggs away from prying
eyes in a corner of the hay.</p>

<p>Laurie thought he had never
smelt anything so delicious as the
odor of the sweet clover grass that
hung down between the boards of
the flooring of the hay loft, and
when a mouse would scurry away,
he would laugh at its being afraid
of him.</p>

<p>Outside in the gathering twilight,
the pigeons were wheeling
and circling overhead, and dipping
to the ground for the corn that lay
scattered among the pebbles.</p>

<p>High overhead, was the dove-cote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on the wagon house. &#8220;Do
the pigeons fly far away, Uncle
Sam? and what are they always
doing?&#8221; asked Laurie when he had
watched them for some time. &#8220;They
fly ever so far away, Laurie,&#8221; answered
Uncle Sam, &#8220;but always
come back again. Some pigeons
you know, the carrier pigeons, carry
messages, but I do not think this
kind is used for that purpose.&#8221;
Meantime Aunt Laura had come
out to scatter corn to the chickens,
who, seeing her approach, hurried
to meet her on all sides, until she
stood surrounded by the pretty
feathered creatures. Laurie begged
for a handful of corn to throw to
them, but started back in dismay,
when an old turkey-gobbler reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
up and picked a grain out of
his hand. &#8220;What a rude old bird,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but I wasn&#8217;t a bit afraid
of him, he only surprised me,&#8221; he
explained to Aunt Laura quickly,
for fear she would think him timid.
Just then the turkey, who was a
pompous sort of creature, cocked
his head on one side, and looked
at Laurie for a moment as though
he understood, then turned away.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;What a rude old bird,&#8221; said Laurie.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you have hurt his
feelings,&#8221; said Aunt Laura, &#8220;you
see he is not used to little boys
calling him names&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll
not do it any more, I&#8217;m sure I
didn&#8217;t know he minded,&#8221; replied
Laurie, &#8220;but still,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;it&#8217;s not as if he really understood,
he couldn&#8217;t unless he were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>a fairy&mdash;but turkeys, and cows
and pigeons on farms are not
fairies, are they, Aunt Laura?&#8221;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that, Laurie,&#8221;
said Aunt Laura, &#8220;for I&#8217;ve never
seen any fairies&mdash;some animals
are more sensible than others, and
some like to be petted, and are
fond of being with people&mdash;if that
is what you mean.&#8221; &#8220;No, that is
not what I mean altogether, it&#8217;s
only part of what I mean,&#8221; he
answered; &#8220;if the turkey-gobbler
wasn&#8217;t a fairy, it ought not to make
any difference to him, my calling
him rude or not, for he couldn&#8217;t
understand, but he looked at me
in such a funny way, with his head
on one side, that he must have
known what I was saying.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;I</span>&nbsp;couldn&#8217;t</span> be a bit lonely
here, Aunt Laura,&#8221; he said,
as he was sitting on the floor that
night beside his bed, struggling
to take off his shoes and stockings
all by himself, &#8220;you see even when
you and Uncle Sam are too busy
for me to &#8217;sturb you, I can just
go out and play with the chickens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and talk to the little calf, and
&#8216;pretend.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lots of fun &#8216;pretending,&#8217;&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;I can pretend, oh!
ever so many things&mdash;I learned to
do it when I had the mumps, and
had to stay in bed. It wasn&#8217;t half
so bad the having to stay in bed
then. I used to pretend I was a
magician sometimes, and could
turn my toys into real soldiers,
and real ships, and it used to be
lots of fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we shall ever
be too busy for you to disturb us,
Laurie,&#8221; said Aunt Laura.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, may I peep into that
funny little door?&#8221; Laurie exclaimed,
as he caught sight of a tiny closet
over the mantelpiece. &#8220;Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
does it go to, does it go into the
chimney?&#8221; Aunt Laura laughed,
&#8220;No, it does not go into the
chimney, though everybody who
sees it thinks so at first.&#8221; And
indeed that seemed the only place
that it could open into, for it was
exactly over the fireplace, where
the chimney must be. To be sure
the fireplace had been boarded up
and painted white, and was never
used now; in its stead a great iron
stove like a box, where corn cobs
were burned, was used in winter,
for that made the room much
warmer, but certainly the little
closet had been built at the same
time as the house, when the fireplace
and the chimney had been
built.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know where
it goes to, Laurie,&#8221; said Aunt
Laura, &#8220;it has always been there.
When I was a little girl I used
to think it was a door into another
part of the house, that I did
not know about, where I had
never been, and I used to stand
on a chair and peep in, but it was
too dark to see in all the way.
I keep some of my jellies in it
now,&#8221; she added, and as she spoke,
she opened the door, and showed
him a tempting row of tumblers,
filled with clear amber jelly, neatly
covered with white paper.</p>

<p>Even after Aunt Laura had
tucked him into bed, and given
him a good-night kiss, Laurie
kept wondering about all he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
seen&mdash;there was so much to think
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why the pigeons
keep flying about all day,&#8221; he said
to himself, &#8220;and what chickens
and geese say to each other&mdash;after
all, I don&#8217;t believe they can talk
at all,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;for they do
not seem to be really doing anything&mdash;they
just fly around in a
silly sort of way, picking up crumbs,
I wonder what they would talk
about if they could. I wonder if
I could peep inside the dove-cote
some day and see what it looks
like.&#8221; By this time he was almost
asleep, but he kept repeating to
himself, &#8220;I wonder&mdash;I wonder&mdash;I
wonder,&#8221; over and over again,
until it sounded more like whirrder-whirrder-whirr&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Laurie was almost
sure he had stopped saying
&#8220;wonder&#8221; and something soft like
whirr-whirr sounded close by, as
if one of the pigeons themselves
was flying about the room.</p>

<p>Laurie opened his eyes wide&mdash;&#8220;How
could a pigeon be in <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'his'">this</ins>
room,&#8221; he thought; &#8220;they must
surely be asleep in the dove-cote
by this time.&#8221; The room was quite
dark, except for a little square of
light high upon the wall, but he
gradually made out the different
objects in the room, and saw that
the light came from the little cupboard
on the mantlepiece. He
heard the soft whirr again, this
time close by, and looking up he
saw a pigeon perched on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the four posts of his bed. &#8220;So
you don&#8217;t believe we have any
work to do,&#8221; said the pigeon.
&#8220;Would you like to see inside
the dove-cote? If so, come with
me.&#8221; When he said this, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hovered about the bed for a moment,
then fluttered over to the
mantelpiece, and stood beside the
little cupboard.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus035.jpg"><img src="images/illus035_th.jpg"
alt="Laurie enters the cupboard" title="Laurie enters the cupboard" /></a></p>

<p>Laurie was about to say that
he could not possibly get up to
the door, when he remembered
what Aunt Laura had said about
climbing up on a chair to peep
in, so he jumped out of bed, and
pulling a chair close to the fireplace,
stepped from it to the
mantelpiece. It never occurred to
him until afterwards, to think that
he was ever so much too big to
fit inside the cupboard, and it
really did not matter after all, for
somehow or other he did fit&mdash;whether
he had grown suddenly
quite small, or the cupboard was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
quite large when one got near
enough to it, I do not know,
but there he was inside, with the
pigeon hopping along sedately
ahead of him.</p>

<p>It was apparently a narrow
passage, and very long, for they
walked on for some time, turning
corners now and then, as though
it ran past certain rooms in the
house, and Laurie could see that
it was lit by hundreds of fireflies,
making it almost as bright as day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>uddenly</span> the passageway
came to an end, Laurie does
not remember quite how it happened,
but there he was up in the
dove-cote, high above the farmyard,
with the pigeons cooing and circling
about him.</p>

<p>What a beautiful dove-cote it
was, ever so much larger than one
would have supposed: indeed it
was like a real house.</p>

<p>It did not seem at all strange
for the cooing to sound more and
more like words, and presently
Laurie found that the pigeons were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
inviting him to enter. Inside how
beautiful it all was! Velvet carpets
lay on the floor, with the most
exquisite patterns traced on them;
in each room the pattern was
different, yet always changing, for
they were made by the tiny feet
of the pigeons as they moved
about. Soft curtains hung at the
doors. They were wonderful feather
curtains; instead of having to push
them to one side, all that one had
to do was to move towards them,
and they folded into wings. Exquisite
music sounded in the rooms,
that was the wind, and it sang of
the countries and people it had
seen in its travels. It sang of the
waving corn, the ships at sea, the
flames leaping in the fireplace, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
crooned a lullaby it had heard a
mother singing to her baby&mdash;now
the voice of the wind was soft and
low, that was when it remembered
the places it had been in, where
there was peace and happiness; now
it was loud and harsh, for it had
also been in terrible storms, and
wild places, ah! they were wonderful
stories. No one was idle in
the dove-cote, some pigeons were
kept busy writing the news that
the wind brought, others flew here
and there, for they were the messengers,
and must carry the news
over the farm.</p>

<p>One pigeon had a ring over
his ankle: he was very important
indeed, quite a personage in the
dove-cote.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus041.jpg"><img src="images/illus041_th.jpg"
alt="Some pigeons were kept busy writing the news that the wind brought" title="Some pigeons were kept busy writing the news that the wind brought" /></a></p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to dance for
you,&#8221; he said to Laurie, and seven
pigeons stepped into the centre
of the room. They began with a
faint flutter of their wings, turning
their heads from side to side, gradually
growing swifter in their motion,
until their brilliant colors blended
and intermingled in a beautiful
prismatic effect. It was like a
wonderful rainbow dance, only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
colors changed as the pigeons
moved about, and they opened
and closed their wings in such
a way, that they seemed to ripple
and flow as water does over the
stones.</p>

<p>Their cooing gradually sounded
more and more like water gurgling,
and Laurie listened and listened,
until he found his head nodding&mdash;he
was almost asleep&mdash;no, he was
not asleep, he opened his eyes
wide, there was the pigeon still,
with the ring about his ankle, but
the dancing pigeons were no longer
there; the blue sky shone between
trunks of trees, and a real brook
sparkled over the stones&mdash;somehow
or other they were walking
through a wood, the same wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
on the edge of the fields, that
they had driven past on their way
to the farm: how quiet it was and
how deliciously soft the moss underfoot,
while a gentle breeze swayed
the trees overhead.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus043.jpg"><img src="images/illus043_th.jpg"

<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;Now we will stop at the squirrel house,&#8221;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now we will stop at the
squirrel&#8217;s house,&#8221; said the pigeon,
as they stopped at an old tree.
&#8220;Rap-tap-rap&#8221; with his beak on a
knot-hole in the trunk, and a fat
squirrel opened the door. What a
lot of chattering! he was inviting
them to enter. &#8220;How delightful,&#8221;
thought Laurie as they stepped inside,
&#8220;now I shall see what a
squirrel&#8217;s house is really like.&#8221;</p>

<p>And indeed it was very
different from what he had supposed
an old tree to be like inside; instead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there was a real little staircase,
carpeted with green moss,
winding up through the hollow
trunk, there were landings at the
different branches, with tiny doors
opening off them, and the branches
themselves were all little rooms
with knot-holes for windows, across
which green leaves were hung for
curtains.</p>

<p>The walls were papered with
the most beautiful paper in the
world; in one room it was all
blossoms with the most delicate
odor; in another the walls were
hung with green leaves; in another
room great red and yellow autumn
leaves festooned the walls. &#8220;You
see this is the inside out or rather
the outside in of the tree,&#8221; explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the squirrel; &#8220;this is where the
blossoms and leaves are kept when
not in use.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all a little confusing at
first to Laurie, for the squirrels
seemed to be in such haste, but
they were so friendly, and chattered
so pleasantly to him that somehow
or other he understood everything
they were saying, though they
talked in squirrel language, and so
by-and-by he felt more at home,
and sat down while they brought
him some refreshments.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus047.jpg"><img src="images/illus047_th.jpg"
alt="Such delicious morsels, served in the most tempting manner"
title="Such delicious morsels, served in the most tempting manner" /></a></p>

<p>Such delicious morsels, served
in the most tempting manner!
Pur&eacute;e of chestnuts, and hickory-nut
cake&mdash;wonderful cherry cordial,
made, the squirrels explained to
Laurie, out of melted sap of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
wild cherry tree&mdash;exquisite walnuts
baked in acorn cups. Oh! I can&#8217;t
tell you half what there was, for
Laurie did not know himself, but
it was all very delicious, and the
squirrels too seemed to think it
an important occasion, for there
was a great deal of whisking of
tails, and the squirrel waiters sat
up very stiffly with their little
paws held up in front of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as though they knew how much
was expected of them and meant
to do their share. Every now and
then Laurie would see a pair of
bright eyes peeping at him over
the stair, then off would scurry a
baby squirrel afraid of being caught,
&#8220;for all the world,&#8221; thought Laurie,
&#8220;the way we do at home when
we are forbidden to come down
when mother is giving a party, so
watch instead from a landing on
the stair when nurse&#8217;s back is
turned.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus049.jpg"><img src="images/illus049_th.jpg"
alt="The squirrel led the way down the winding stair."
title="The squirrel led the way down the winding stair." /></a></p>
<p class="caption"><i>The squirrel led the way down the winding stair.</i></p>

<p>After the refreshments, there
was more bowing and waving of
bushy tails and hand shaking or
paw shaking, I do not know which&mdash;for
it was time to be off; Laurie
thanked them very much and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he would like to come again,
which was very true indeed, and
he said in his most &#8220;grown up
way&#8221; that he had had a delightful
time, and the squirrels seemed
pleased and nodded again, and
the same old squirrel, who must
have been the door-keeper, for he
kept jingling a great bunch of
keys in his hands, now led the
way down the winding stair again,
until they reached what must have
been the cellar part of the tree,
where the squirrels kept their
stores for the winter. It had
grown so dark that their guide
now took a lantern down from
the wall and, fastening a glow
worm inside to light the way,
showed Laurie great piles of nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and acorns stacked in the corners.
<span class="figleft"><a href="images/illus052.jpg"><img src="images/illus052_th.jpg"
alt="an old owl put out his head"
title="an old owl put out his head" /></a></span>
After a while they came to a little
door and, passing through it&mdash;the
squirrel leading the way, after him
the pigeon, and Laurie bringing
up the rear&mdash;they found themselves
in a long passage, smelling of earth
and mould. &#8220;It surely must be
underground,&#8221; thought Laurie, &#8220;I
wonder if the moles and mice have
streets just as we do. Oh, dear!
I do hope we don&#8217;t meet that
dreadful turkey-gobbler.&#8221; Before
he had time to think much about
it, they came to another little door,
on the other side of which was a
stair that evidently led up into
another tree.</p>

<p>Here the squirrel with the
lantern bade them good-bye, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
disappeared down
the corridor. The
pigeon led the
way up the stair,
at the top of
which was a rough
wooden door.
&#8220;We must leave
a message here,&#8221;
said he, tapping on
the door, and after
waiting some time, Laurie thought
he heard a gruff voice say, &#8220;To-who-to-who?&#8221;
&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he
come and see instead of asking?&#8221;
thought Laurie, but just then the
door opened, and an old owl put
out his head.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> owl looked very sleepy,
and blinked his eyes very
hard. &#8220;He must have been asleep,&#8221;
said Laurie to himself, &#8220;owls
always do sleep in the day-time I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who-oo!&#8221; screeched the owl,
flapping his wings and ruffling up
his feathers, and looking very hard
at Laurie. &#8220;Oh, dear! I beg
your pardon,&#8221; said Laurie, feeling
very much frightened indeed, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean to be rude, but all the
birds and animals on the farm here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have such a curious way of knowing
what I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221; The owl
paid no attention to him, however,
but opened the door wider for them
to enter, and Laurie, keeping close
behind the pigeon, stepped in. The
owl was evidently a bachelor, for
his room was very untidy; books
and papers lay piled about in the
greatest confusion, and while he
tried in a clumsy way to make
room for them, every now and then
he would upset something, as he
was extremely near-sighted. He
finally pushed a revolving globe
on a stand toward Laurie, evidently
thinking it a stool; it was
very uncomfortable to sit on, and
it had a way of turning round at
the least little motion, and Laurie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hoped that whatever the message
was the pigeon would not remain
long.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus055.jpg"><img src="images/illus055_th.jpg"
alt="The owl reads over the paper" title="The owl reads over the paper" /></a></p>

<p>The pigeon now brought out
a folded paper from a pocket
underneath his wing, and handed
it to the owl, who opened it, and
said he would give it due consideration
on reading it over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
After listening to their conversation
awhile Laurie learned that the owl,
because of his wisdom, was the
judge who decided the serious
affairs and quarrels among the
other birds and animals. The room
was built in the hollow of a dead
tree&mdash;it was quite snug, but not
half so nice as the squirrel house,
for there was no pretty wall paper,
and a great spider-web instead
hung across one corner of the
room; on one side was an oval
window, out of which could be
seen wood and meadow, and on
a peg against the wall hung a
warm winter cloak of soft moleskin.
The owl now gravely folded
and sealed several legal-looking
documents, and gave them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
pigeon, who, tucking them away
in the same pocket, flapped his
wings, and, nodding to Laurie to
jump on his back, flew out into
the sunshine. Laurie had hardly
time to wonder where the pigeon
was taking him to this time, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he saw the farm below them,
and they alighted on the roof of
the barn.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus058.jpg"><img src="images/illus058_th.jpg"
alt="Laurie was standing on the top of the barn roof"
title="Laurie was standing on the top of the barn roof" /></a></p>


<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo,&#8221; crowed
the rooster on the weather-vane,
but he really thought he was saying
&#8220;How-de-do-de-do?&#8221; He was
a splendid fellow, for he was pure
gold and shone in the sunlight;
he turned this way and that for
everybody to see him, until the
common fowls in the barn-yard
envied him and wished themselves
in his place, though if they had
only known it they were far better
off than he, for they could pick up
corn and worms, while he was
obliged to stand there always,
which was not so pleasant on
rainy days. He was terribly hoarse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
too, from the damp weather, and
it made his voice sound like a
rusty hinge that needed oiling.
&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&#8221; he said to
Laurie, and Laurie bowed the best
way he could, which was not very
easy considering that he was standing
on the top of the barn roof.
&#8220;So you are the little boy who
has come to visit at the farm-house;
I saw you drive in. I see
everything and everybody, people
come and people go; it is a mistake
to think that one must travel
to see the world: I prefer to remain
at home, but then every one is
not as bright as I&#8221;&mdash;he certainly
was conceited&mdash;&#8220;still I am never
idle,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;for I have
my work to do; the farmer cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
do without me. I warn him of a
change of weather, but not everyone
who is changeable can be
depended upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the pigeon interrupted
him to tell him what the wind had
said of a storm coming, and he
promised to look toward the east
for it. The wind had certainly got
up, there was no doubting it; the
weathercock and pigeon were right,
it was going to rain, big drops
were pattering down on the roof.</p>

<p>Laurie looked round to find
the pigeon, but he had disappeared,
no doubt for fear he would get
his feathers wet. &#8220;Serves you
right, serves you right!&#8221; sounded
close to Laurie&#8217;s ear, and beside
him stood the turkey-gobbler. &#8220;So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you thought the pigeons just flew
round in a silly sort of way,
picking up crumbs did you,&#8221; he
said&mdash;or gobbled I should say,
his voice was so cross&mdash;&#8220;and you
didn&#8217;t suppose we had our work
to do as well as the people on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the farm, did you?&#8221; he really looked
very alarming as he ruffled up his
feathers and spread out his tail
like a great fan. &#8220;Serves you
right, to be left out in the rain
this way,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;next
time you&#8217;ll have better manners,
I hope, than to call any one a
rude bird.&#8221; Laurie was very much
frightened indeed&mdash;it was raining
harder and harder; he started to
run: patter, patter, patter, sounded
the feet of the turkey behind him,
&#8220;gobble, gobble,&#8221;&mdash;patter, patter,&mdash;no,
it was only the rain drops this
time, he was quite out of breath,
where was he?</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus062.jpg"><img src="images/illus062_th.jpg"
alt="The turkey-gobbler" title="The turkey-gobbler" /></a></p>

<p>He looked about him, he was
no longer in the barnyard&mdash;of
course he knew where he was now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
but&mdash;how frightened he had been;
he rubbed his eyes, it was morning,
the sun shone and there was
Aunt Laura clapping her hands
in the doorway to waken him.
&#8220;Wake up, wake up, Laurie,&#8221; she
said&mdash;&#8220;why dear me,&#8221; she added
in a puzzled way, looking up at
the mantelpiece, &#8220;how did I happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to forget to shut the cupboard door
last night?&#8221;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus063.jpg"><img src="images/illus063_th.jpg"
alt="&#8220;How did I happen to forget to shut the cupboard door last night?&#8221;"
title="&#8220;How did I happen to forget to shut the cupboard door last night?&#8221;" /></a></p>

<p>Perhaps she forgot to shut it,
or the pigeon forgot, I do not
know; anyway that is the end of
the Pigeon Story, children;&mdash;and
maybe to-morrow, when the stockings
are all darned, and the toys
put neatly away, I shall tell you
the Field Mouse Tale, or the Duck
Tale or the Windmill Tale, for
there are four altogether&mdash;would
you like to hear them?</p>
